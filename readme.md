__Credit To The Owner!__

this is a bot that i modified from some repositories

This bot allows you to run with pm2 directly because I removed the question option, 
why? because pm2 can't handle to select options like
"`use proxy? y/N`"

yes, i removed that for PM2, and i also removed a proxy that allows you to run bots directly with your internet network
