__Credit to the owner!__
this is a bot that i modified from some repositories
This bot allows you to run with pm2 directly because I removed the question option, because pm2 doesn't allow you to select options like
"`use proxy? y/N`"

yes, i removed that for those of you who like it fast, and i also removed a proxy that allows you to run bots directly with your internet network
